# HayaiLedger

## General Overview

This application is still a work in progress. The goal is to build a double accounting compliant ledger system with Elixir. Elixir was chosen due to its incredible tools, easy to read and understand syntax, powerful scaling, and overall great community. 

There are many features to this approach
- Once integrated the ledger can ensure an easy accounting export of data
- The ledger follows strict Accounting principles thus ensuring financial data integrety
- There is locking/blocking that is non-database dependant allowing much better throughput
- Scaling and performance were amazing under tests

This has been mostly exploratory and new ideas testing for proof of concept and personal knowledge. This app has been integrated into a few other apps (which are private) and the perfomance/reliability has been astounding.

Testing and further enhancements on this version are stopped for now due to proprietary use of parts of this on a commercial application, once that is complete may come back to update and open source what was discovered and used here.
